## Start coding! 

Start coding your React Application application, update the `index.scss` or `index.js` depending on your needs.
Add more files into your `./views`, `./components` or styles folder as you need them.

## Publish your website! 

This boilerplate is 100% compatible with the free github pages hosting.
